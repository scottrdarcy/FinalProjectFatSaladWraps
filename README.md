# FinalProjectFatSaladWraps
This is my final project.  

The project is three HTML pages:


Home.1.html
menu.1.html
contactus.html

Two CSS pages:

Home.1.css
contactus.css


Two Java Script Files:
special.js 
second.js (Not actually being used)


Special Instructions and other Comments:  


Home Page-  I began with a slide show, my goal was to make it so I could present 
 pictures of salads and special offers.  I realize that if I had learned Bootstrap first
 I could create something much nicer.  I used the same image, because I have not learned how to 
 customize their sizes properly. 

 Making this page repsonive was a little challenging.  I now realize that good knowledge of css is the key.  I have a much better understanding on how to use the "display" and "position" properties since completing the project.

 Menu Page- 
 I really tried to get creative here.  The goal was to get a head start and start learning the back end functionality.  The problem I ran into, was that every time I added something to the page I had a problem with responsiveness.  Lesson leaerned.  On this page you will find my java script, a work in process. It wasnt my intial plan, but it is a step towards it. 

Contact Us-  
I wanted to show of some bootstrap with this page for extra credit.  I attached this page so that all pages would be linked.  It is still a work in process.



The is not finished, but it meets all the requirements for the final project.  

I know I have along way to go, but I am enjoying the ride.  

I am very grateful for Code Louisville, and look forward to fine tuning all these 

new concepts that I have learned. 

Thank You,  

Scott
